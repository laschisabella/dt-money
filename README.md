<h1> Hello, welcome to dt money ðŸ˜Š </h1> 

## About the project
This project is part of the React.js program of [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/), with few modifications I have made myself. The idea is to practice simple React.js and front-end development concepts, including:
- the use of Context (and creating a hook for it)
- the styled components library
- the axios and miragejs library to practice consuming API's, even though there's not a real one for this project.
