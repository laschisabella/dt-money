# Hello, welcome to dt money :]

## About the project
This project is part of the React.js program of @rocketseat , where I have made a few modifications myself. The idea is to practice simple React.js and front-end development concepts, including:
- the use of Context (and creating a hook for it)
- the styled components library
- the axios and miragejs library to practice consuming API's, even though there's not a real one for this project.
